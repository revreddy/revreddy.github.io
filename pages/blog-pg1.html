                <h2><a id="2014sept30-osx-yosemite" class="anchor">OSX 10.10 Yosemite: &nbsp;More iOS for the Desktop</a></h2>
                <p>Apple continues to transform OSX into its next era with drastic overhauls both visually and feature-wise. This review will cover some of the major features that have impacted my usage of OSX thus far during beta testing as well as areas that can be improved for next year's California-themed release, OSX 10.10 (Yosemite).</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/blog/osx-yosemite-desktop.jpg" alt="Macbook Desktop with OSX Yosemite"/>
                <h3>Design:</h3>
                <p>The implementation of transparency, which Apple calls Vibrancy, across all windows attempts to accomplish what Windows Vista first introduced with the Aero transparency. However, Apple goes a step further with the use of iOS "frost" by adding it to every menu and sidebar across all applications giving it a very cool effect.</p>
                <p>Biggest area of concern is that Vibrancy is appears quite graphics intensive for even simple tasks like swiping between desktops, which is causing noticeable lag experienced on my very capable 2014 MacBook Pro. The lag is slightly less in Beta 3 compared to Beta 2, but still noticeably present. Users on older machines will probably see their machines struggle to keep up with the graphics refresh rates. Knowing this, Apple took precautions to add a handy option to disable Vibrancy, located in System Preferences&gt;Accessibility&gt;Reduce Transparency. This toggle is also very useful when away from the desk and attempting to maximize battery life. Once transparency is turned off, everything that was previously frosty now defaults to a shade of solid white-gray, while the notification sidebar defaults to solid black. I really hope that Apple can fix the lag issue in final release as I would love to keep this aesthetically pleasing feature turned on.</p>
                <p>Apple also made another giant leap in fully abandoning skeuomorphism, the concept of having visual design mimicking the looks of the real-life object. For example, the Notes app would resemble the actual notepad with yellow pages, blue lines, and black binding at the top. Those that appreciate this design argue that this gives a sense of realism. However, critics of skeuomorphism argue the design makes application appear too busy, taking attention focus away from its actual use. The replacement is a flat simple design, much like what we have already seen in iOS 7 and 8. Gradients and textures are less harsh by incorporating the flat design trend we have seen over the past couple of years.</p>
                <h3>Dock: </h3>
                <p>Apple decided to retire the 3D icons-sitting-on-a-glass design and resurrect the default older flat box from OSX 10.4 (Tiger). This box has always been a hidden feature in recent releases that could be manually turned on, but never saw the need to. Without all the 3D aspects of the docks, the dock does look more pleasant. Much like the Windows taskbar, it appears to take the most prominent color of the desktop wallpaper and make it slightly darker to provide sufficient contrast for the icons to be clearly visible. Apple also opted for mostly circular icons with bright colors that resemble their iOS counter parts for their default Apple apps, like Safari, iTunes, Facetime, and App Store.</p>
                <h3>Safari:</h3>
                <p>I have always sworn by Google Chrome as my default browser, primarily for the handy Google sync features for keeping my bookmarks updated on the ever growing list of devices I own (Mac, PC, MotoX, Nexus 7) and the better support for useful extensions like autoscrolling and hover-to-zoom. The only downsides to using Chrome on a laptop is that is fairly resource intensive even for even the most basic use, which would translate to roughly a 1-2 hour decrease in battery life. Considering I had been getting close 6 hours or more battery life most of the time, it was a sacrifice I was more than willing to make for the sake of convenience and familiarity.</p>
                <p>However, Safari 8 received a massive visual upgrade that made it more appealing to use thanks to the flatter UI design. The tab bar got two major changes. First, the way the current tab is now a simple highlight that is contrasted from the other tabs, which is less distracting to the way it was in previous versions. Second, tab overflow now prevents your tabs from shrinking excessively to the point you cannot even read the tab names. Instead, it allows you to scroll through the tabs by using left-right gestures on the trackpad while the mouse is hovered over the tab bar. Speaking of gestures, Apple continues to excel in providing intuitive gestures to make browsing as easy as possible and to minimize the need move the mouse for basic tasks, like page back/forward.</p>
                <p>Tab overview is also improved by now intelligently grouping similar webpages into stacks, allowing for better management of the ever increasing number of open tabs. Another handy addition is an easy shortcut added right next to the back/forward buttons to open the sidebar containing bookmark and reading list. The sidebar once again brings the beautiful transparency effects into view.</p>
                <p>A major gripe is the lack of favicons makes it harder for me to identify a particular tab or bookmark rather than reading the title of each. Another is the inability to reopen more than one recently closed tab. Cmd+Z command will undo the most recent close tab, but if you accidently close more than one, then you are out of luck. Only way to retrieve that tab is dig into the browser history and find the page.</p>
                <p>Sadly, I do not see Apple fulfilling these longstanding feature requests anytime soon due to their obsession with maintaining a clean and simple UI design over useful functionality. Safari, in general, has always consistently lagged behind in implementing features that have been standardized in Chrome and Firefox for years. Kind of like delaying the addition of copy and paste until iOS 5 despite the apparent need for it in all previous versions. Nevertheless, the lightweight nature of the browser is what also allows for the excellent performance optimization and battery life efficiency that is unparalleled to any other browser for OSX, making it a browser that any Macbook user should incorporate into their workflow to some extent.</p>
                <h3>Notification Center:</h3>
                <p>When the notification center was first introduced in OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion), there was certainly some initial excitement. Apple implemented a notification system that mimicks the functionality of the popular <a href="http://growl.info" title="Growl homepage">Growl</a> app. Growl provides discrete popup notifications at the top right of the screen for various apps. The sidebar is based on the concept of having a space to hold notifications much like the notification bar on iOS/Android. In practicality, the sidebar is entirely useless and did not actually have much value to my workflow. If anything, the off chance when I did open the notification bar, it bothered me when notifications accumulated inside, triggering my OCD-like behavior to click the x's to clear them out. The only useful feature for some users is the ability to write social media status messages, such as for facebook and twitter, right from the sidebar. But, most users probably have a much more powerful twitter client running on the desktop or prefer to visit the website itself to post their updates and see their whole feed. Mavericks did not add anything useful worth mentioning other than a slight polish in the design of the sidebar.</p>
                <h3>Today View:</h3>
                <p>With Yosemite, Apple is finally realizing the fruits of its initial hard work. The notification bar now looks more like a dashboard replacement with the implementation of widgets for calendar, stocks, weather, and calculator. Apple took this a step further and allowed third party extensions can create their own widgets and allow users to add additional functionality to the sidebar. For example, the popular Airmail app recently added a widget to quickly view your inbox, todo, and memo right from the sidebar. Even though the old dashboard now has an option to disable it entirely, I still leave it on to use the post-it notes to write down quick comments.</p>
                <h3>Spotlight:</h3>
                <p>In previous releases, Spotlight would open from the top right corner and display as a dropdown menu. In Yosemite, it looks and functions very similar the popular app <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" title="Alfred homepage">Alfred</a>. A popup text field shows up at the center of the screen for maximum focus. As soon as you start typing, the search results are displayed and the most relevant suggestion is an autocomplete, similar to how the google search box works. To take things a step further, you can perform tasks like initiating a google search using contextual commands, similar to telling Siri to perform a task except you to type it out. This is still easier than opening safari and then typing out your search query when one step can suffice to achieve the same result. Spotlight usage overall is much more responsive and visually appealing over its predecessor, making it the most abused OSX feature in my daily workflow.</p>
                <h3>Dark mode:</h3>
                <p>All the late night Mac users will rejoice in having the ability to invert the status bar to black. The dock also turns to a shade of dark gray. Only problem is the status bar looks weird, possibly due to the lack of any texture or shadows. This is another area that I hope Apple does work on, and app developers also need to ensure their status bar icons cooperate with the color inversion.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>As mentioned earlier in this review, Apple tends to favor design over features, making it quite difficult to predict how specific implementations will be made. We already knew Apple was pushing the UI design more towards iOS 8, but there was major concern as to what extent they were going to merge the two. Thankfully, Apple found a good balance and I am very pleased with how Yosemite turned out. The addition of transparency and much improved Safari, Spotlight, and notifications center provide a sizable net benefit for users to look forward to.</p>

                <h2><a id="2014sept29-windows-threshold" class="anchor">Windows Threshold: &nbsp;Return of the Start Menu</a></h2>
                <p>Over the past decade, we have had five releases of Windows: &nbsp;XP (2001), Vista (2007), 7 (2009), 8 (2012), and 8.1 (2013). I would like to cover the various reason for the successes or failures of each release in the context of Microsoft's decision making and end user reactions.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/blog/windows-logo-cyan.png" alt="Windows Logo"/>
                <h3>Making Progress</h3>
                <p>Windows XP will easily down as one of the greatest operating system releases of all time given its long reign and significant leap from the old Windows 98 classic grey design. This lengthy product cycle allowed Microsoft to optimize and make it functionally secure, hence garnering heavy favor with enterprise users as well.</p>
                <p>Despite what many will say about Windows Vista as being one of the worst OS's in recent history, I will always counter this notion in arguing that it was a necessary step in the right direction, otherwise Windows 7 would not have turned out as great as it did. The major improvements in the features and UI, such as well the new transparency dubbed Aero, were functionally sound and appealing for users. However, the culprit can be attributed to Microsoft's new three year developmental cycle. When they reached their branching deadline to stop adding new features for Vista, they were left with bulky, unoptimized, and sluggish code. The end result was high resource requirements, particularly memory, that left two to three year old PCs struggling to run it. Even newer PCs had some difficulties, to the that Microsoft requested OEMs to distinguish capable machines with the addition of "Certified for Windows Vista" stickers, but the damage had already been done. With all the UI and security changed, most enterprise IT customers decided to completely skip the Vista upgrade altogether, further allowing XP to stay mainstream for a few more years.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, Microsoft listened to the PC community to slim down the resource requirements and drastically improve performance with the release of Windows 7 in 2010. In the same period of time, they worked with OEMs to ensure new PCs would were ready to handle W7 without issue. Even the User Account Control (UAC), which was more annoying than helpful in Vista, had been tuned down to be more tolerable for users to still take advantage of its extra security without incessant warnings. For the first time since XP, we finally had a polished operating system that brought a great addition to the workflow in the form of the Taskbar. Anyone who still willingly uses XP now is just plain foolish.</p>
                <h3>Vista 2.0</h3>
                <p>Why is W8 lagging behind a 12 year old legacy OS? Well, Microsoft shot themselves in the foot by misguided changes to one of the most iconic features of all time: &nbsp;the start menu. They replaced it with something so alien that even power users, like myself, have trouble using it efficiently. The basic premise behind the start page was to combine mobile tablet interface with the desktop, essentially creating one platform of Windows that could be installed across all devices, including laptops with touchscreens and their first generation of Surface tablets. What Microsoft failed to understand is the usage between the devices are entirely different, let alone forcing people to alter their workflow from the only way they have ever known is an uphill battle. Where they were getting their marketing research from and who concluded the data suggested consumers actually wanted this? As the saying goes, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." And if you plan to improve something, make sure it is actually an improvement over the existing working implementation without sacrificing its strengths.</p>
                <p>Beta testing W8 was an absolute frustration. I struggled to using the new start page. The whole interface was not very mouse friendly. I found myself clicking the start button many times only to realize that start menu no longer exists. The lack of a concise "All Programs" in a vertical list further added to the confusion and frustration. Any user with lots of software and games installed would have to deal with unnecessary horizontally scrolling through the start page to find the program they want. The settings menu was also an absolute mess and proved quite difficult to find what you were looking for. The charms bar was glitchy and took too long to slide open. Brutal truth remains that it completely hindered the workflow to the point it only took me a week or so to ditch the beta and revert back to my main W7 partition. This compares to my default usage of every W7 beta version that was released until the final RTM.</p>
                <h3>Misguided Changes</h3>
                <p>The start page had Microsoft in denial during the early public testing with the overall backlash from the community, including myself. They compromised by adding settings for controlling the behavior and common annoyances of the start page. Microsoft had every opportunity to listen to the community and implement a setting to disable the start page altogether prior to its launch, instead they later pay the price for it in the form of lost sales/upgrades. I do understand that Microsoft invested three years building on that concept and to abandon it at the last minute would have been devastating from a investment cost and company morale. However, a product that is as widely used by as Windows should not be a playground to experiment on concepts without any regard to the productivity of the users.</p>
                <p>As a power user, I gracefully embraced the change nevertheless and learned to live with W8.1. While many have turned to third part mods like Stardock's Start8 to full restore the W7-like start menu, but I wanted to keep my Windows pure. I just avoided as much of the start page as possible by pinning my most used programs on the taskbar and the making shortcuts to the desktop. I have boot to desktop setting enabled to bypass the start page at login. If I ever have to access the settings, I prefer right-clicking the Windows icon and then open the classic Control Panel window instead.</p>
                <p>The Modern apps are overall useless, which is why I have the program list showing as default when the start page is opened for the occasional times that I do use it. Why would someone want to use apps with limited features when they could simply use a full featured version of the program from the desktop? The duplication of functionality is unnecessary. Furthermore, general lack of quality apps is disturbing, but expected, since most developers do not want to waste time creating apps for a platform that few users have embraced.</p>
                <h3>Saving Face</h3>
                <p>Within all of this disorganized mess, there are positive aspects of W8 that do not go unnoticed. There are under-the-hood improvements in security and performance, like faster startup and wake from sleep, along with a handful of useful features, such as the ability to mount ISO files natively. The overall Modern design with the flatter windows and textures are a pleasant welcome over the glossy Aero glass-like effect. A reduction in graphics strain likely led to some improvements in battery life for laptop users. OneDrive cloud syncing of user profiles and settings comes in handy if you use Windows across multiple machines, in my case, Parallels desktop. Search is extremely responsive search as I do find myself using it frequently to open a program or find a setting rather than manually navigating for it. I would attribute this behavior to my excessive use of Spotlight in OSX for performing the equivalent tasks.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to today and we are close to the unveiling of Windows Threshold. The screenshot and video leaks so far confirm that Microsoft has fulfilled our biggest feature request. The start menu is back. There is also a number of features that appear heavily resemble its OSX counterpart, but this is not a bad thing. Productivity improvement should remain Microsoft's number one priority going forward and this release appears to show their renewed dedication to bring meaningful features to users. I will write another follow up post once I get my hands on the technical preview and take it for a spin.</p>
