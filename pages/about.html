                <h2>About the author</h2>
                <p> My name is Revanth Reddy. I am a developer and designer from Chicago with a passion for science and technology. I am constantly taking on new challenging endeavors in a neverending quest for self-actualization, while experiencing the many joys and intricacies that life has to offer. Areas of interests and hobbies include consumer tech, traveling, photography, movies, gaming, and much more.</p>
                <p> An overview of my qualifications and skills can be found on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/revanthreddy">LinkedIn</a> profile. Suggestions for future content creation and offers for professional collaboration are always welcome. Feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:revanthreddy1@gmail.com">email</a> or any other social methods provided at the bottom of the page.</p>
                <h2>Site Development</h2>
                <p> Building this site has allowed me to broaden my skills into front end development and design. The base code is predominantly HTML/CSS, most of which was written from scratch using general educational and reference resources around the internet, along with some helper files from HTML5 Boilerplate to fill the gaps where needed.
                <p> It goes without saying that the site is a work in progress. My first release primarily focused on getting an elegant site that can be compatible for viewing on desktop browsers. Upcoming improvements to the site include a better implementation of responsive layouts and experimentation with Javascript. The rapidly changing landscape of internet browsers and web standards will bring exciting new tools in the coming years, allowing for further refinement in future iterations.</p>
                <h2>Blogging</h2>
                <p>The primary objective of my posts is to take a highly analytical approach to discussing various current topics of interest. Testing new products has always been a fun learning experience, but companies always have a reason creating the product or service in the first place. Some influential factors include technological advancements, consumer psychology, unmet market needs, and competition. I intend to shed light on the utility of these products, the logic behind their development, and how end users will react. In doing so, I hope this exposes the reader to more insightful and informative content they would otherwise be unable to find on more popular blogs. Occasionally, I will also incorporate more personal endeavors as well.</p>
