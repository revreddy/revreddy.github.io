                <p>Android 5.0, codenamed Lollipop to continue the tradition of naming after sweet deserts, was announced by Google in October. Since then, there has been a frantic race for OEMs to be the first to push the update to their devices as soon as the source becomes available to the public.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/blog/android-lollipop-forest.jpg" alt="Android Lollipop Forest"/>
                <h3>Renewed Competition</h3>
                <p>A year ago, Motorola set an important precedent among Android OEMs that phone quality and software experience trumps raw specs. They accomplished this by building the first generation of MotoX with stock version of Android without any tacky skins that impact the phone's performance and focused on value added features like active display and always-on voice commands. They took things a step further by rolling out Android 4.4 Kitkat within a month after the source code was made available. This was unprecedented at the time when no other oem had any motivation to push the update that quickly.</p>
                <p>This year, others OEMs have stepped in effort to prevent Motorola from taking all the glory. LG blasted a <a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/newsroom/contents/64765" title="LG G3 Lollipop Press Release">PR</a> for being the first to release an official Lollipop it to G3 owners...in Poland. Let's be honest, no offense, but how many G3 owners are in Poland? This is basically LG's equivalent of a soak test except they are making such a big spectacle of it. A soak test is basically a limited rolled out to a small subset of users who are willing to test and report issues before a general rollout. Motorola followed with a <a href="http://motorola-blog.blogspot.com/2014/11/its-time-to-unwrap-android-5-lollipop.html">blog post</a> few days later with formal soak tests of Lollipop on their flagship MotoX Pure Edition without any grandstanding at all. So why am I discussing this? I just wanted to highlight the silly things that some companies do to grab media attention rather than just focus on providing a quality product above all else.</p>
                <p>It's been over a month since the rollout started. I had been hopeful for getting the lollipop release on my MotoX (2013) by the end of the year, but that outlook is starting to look pretty bleek. A slew of critical bugs have been reportedly found in Lollipop in the recent weeks. Everything from battery drain to glitchy notifications to memory leaks have been found. Motorola seems to have halted the rollout for all their devices, and it will likely not resume until Google is able to hunt down those bugs.</p>
                <h3>Managing Expectations</h3>
                <p>Given that I have the 1st gen MotoX, I expect a slightly delayed release for us as 2nd gen probably has a higher priority to get their OTA. On top of that, AT&amp;T is probably going to delay the update like they usually do for "testing" purposes. So all things considered, an optimistic outlook is for getting Lollipop by end of March depending how soon Google can put out a stable build. Any sooner will be a bonus, assuming no other surprises.</p>

                <p class="right pad-right-10"><img src="../img/blog/filezilla-logo.png" alt="Filezilla Logo" /></p>
                <p> Up until the time of this writing, I have been performing a number of time-consuming steps just to copy a file from my mac onto the linux server for testing. The steps are often as follows:</p>
                <ul class="bullet">
                    <li>Move/copy file to mac desktop (for easy access)</li>
                    <li>Open Terminal</li>
                    <li><i>cd Desktop</i></li>
                    <li><i>scp file.cpp &lt;username&gt;@bert.cs.uic.edu:file.cpp</i></li>
                    <li>Enter password</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Searching for Efficient File Transfers</h3>
                <p> Doing this once is not that big of a deal. The annoyances, however, come when I have to re-upload an updated version of a file, since it require entering a password every single time. I decided to set out onto the interwebs again and find a potential solution. I had already tried experimenting with the saving remote connection in Terminal a few weeks ago, but this only reduces some effort for logging into the server and does not provide shortcuts for transferring files.</p>

                <h3>Simple and Powerful</h3>
                <p> With <a href="https://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a>, I now simply have to open the app, autofill the login info, and then drag and drop files wherever I please. The UI is not exactly going to win any design awards, but this is just one of those apps that is made to get the job done. All the information and functionality is displayed in one single window in logically organized subsections. I look forward to using FileZilla and is a must-have program for any developer needing to access remote servers&nbsp;on a regular basis.</p>
